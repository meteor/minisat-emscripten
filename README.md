Meteor notes: This is a fork of
https://github.com/jgalenson/research.js where we only care about the
`minisat` directory, which contains a script for building MiniSat for
Emscripten.

When using, clone the meteor/minisat repo into the same directory as
this repo, on the 'emscripten' branch.

Original README follows.

### research.js

Share your research online by compiling it to JavaScript!

We will use this repository to host information and scripts
to help researchers port their research projects to JavaScript.
Note that Emscripten changes fairly frequently so these scripts
might not work perfectly; they are intended merely as examples
of how to compile projects with Emscripten.

A short writeup and demos are available [here](http://jgalenson.github.io/research.js/).
